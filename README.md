# 🦅 Falcony Search Engine

Falcony is a multicomponent, AI-powered, Java-based search engine developed for the Advanced Programming Techniques course at Cairo University. It replicates the core functionality of modern search engines—crawling, indexing, ranking, and querying—with a focus on modular architecture, multithreaded performance, and modern web technologies.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Backend:**

  * Java 17
  * Spring Boot
* **Frontend:**

  * React.js
  * JavaScript
  * Tailwind CSS
* **AI Integration:**

  * Image search using a deep learning model (e.g., feature vectors for visual similarity)

---

## 📦 Project Modules

### 1. 🌐 Web Crawler

* Implements a **multithreaded worker pool architecture** with adjustable thread count.
* Crawls **6000+ pages** (HTML, images, links) in **<10 minutes**.
* Features:

  * URL normalization & compact string comparison
  * Duplicate detection
  * `robots.txt` compliance
  * State persistence for resumable crawling
  * Crawl priority queue (BFS-style)

### 2. 🗂️ Indexer

* Parses HTML content and extracts terms with context (title, headers, body).
* Builds an **inverted index** stored in a persistent database.
* Supports:

  * Fast word-based queries
  * Phrase queries with ordered word checks
  * Incremental updates from newly crawled pages

### 3. ⚖️ Ranker

* Calculates:

  * **Relevance**: using TF-IDF, location-based weighting (title, heading, body)
  * **Popularity**: via the **PageRank** algorithm
* Combines relevance and popularity to deliver ranked results

### 4. 🔌 Backend (Spring Boot)

* RESTful APIs to:

  * Process search queries
  * Serve ranked results with snippets
  * Handle image search with AI
  * Serve autocomplete suggestions (based on query history)
* Tracks and logs response time for performance monitoring

### 5. 💻 Frontend (React.js + Tailwind CSS)

* Google-style UI with:

  * Search bar
  * Autocomplete suggestion dropdown
  * Paginated results
  * Snippets with bolded keywords
  * Image search tab
  * Live query time indicator

## 🤖 AI-Powered Image Search

Falcony includes a deep learning-based image search functionality. Features:

* Converts user-uploaded image into a **feature vector**
* Compares against indexed images using **cosine similarity**
* Returns visually similar images ranked by similarity score

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 📦 Prerequisites

* Java 17+
* Node.js & npm
* Spring Boot
* MongoDB / PostgreSQL (for index persistence)
